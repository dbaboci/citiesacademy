It provides a series of themes, topics and readings on cities. The goal is to create a shared entry point to the world of city planning and urbanism. It serves as a general introduction to the field through the lenses of complex adaptive systems.\n"

          [Layer](https://getlayer.xyz) is an urban orchestration platform that
          enables you to plan, design and manage better urban environments. We
          do not expect scientific rationalism to solve cities anytime soon. But
          we can try to improve urban environments by putting state-of-the-art
          tools in the hands of mayors and public officials around the world. We
          aspire to be the software infrastructure that will run the cities of
          tomorrow.

          [thinkthinkthink](https://thinkthinkthink.substack.com/) is my broad
          newsletter on cities, science and complex systems. Consider this a
          personal attempt to clarify my thinking on key urban issues. It might
          sometimes read as a diary - but I hope it will always light-up a
          couple of novel & interesting neural circuits. I usually add a book
          recommendation, three riveting articles and the five most striking
          tweets I encountered during the week.

          [thinkthinkthink](https://thinkthinkthink.substack.com/) is my broad
          newsletter on cities, science and complex systems. Consider this a
          personal attempt to clarify my thinking on key urban issues. It might
          sometimes read as a diary - but I hope it will always light-up a
          couple of novel & interesting neural circuits. I usually add a book
          recommendation, three riveting articles and the five most striking
          tweets I encountered during the week.
